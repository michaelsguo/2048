Testing the sound control button to see if it can control the switch sound normally (When the game is over, you can choose to save the score so that you will come to the leaderboard interface. Your score will be recorded, and then you can return to the game to continue playing. When the game ends again, choose to save the score and the score will be ranked according to the high and low).
